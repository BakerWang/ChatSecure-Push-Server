ChatSecure Push Server
======================

An experimental design for a privacy-minded push server.

Installation
------------

You will need to install [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) using the package manager of your choice:

On Mac OS X, I recommend [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):

    $ brew install -v couchdb

Or on Ubuntu:

    $ apt-get install couchdb

If you don't have Python and pip, get them.

    $ easy_install pip

Setup your virtual environment. You'll probably need to do some more stuff too.

    $ pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
    $ mkvirtualenv cps
    $ workon cps
    
You will need to install the following dependencies: `apns`, `flask`, `couchdbkit`, `requests`, `pycrypto`

    (cps)$ pip install apns flask couchdbkit requests pycrypto
    
Setup

TODO: Write this section.
    

Definitions
---------

**Device Push Token (DPT):** Unique (possibly changing) device token returned from iOS device. This is used by APNs to send messages to a specific endpoint.
**Push Access Token (PAT):** Generated by our server, linked to an account ID, acts as a whitelist.
**APNs:** Apple Push Notification Service
**Receipt:** In-App Purchase Receipt
Server Data Model----------
    {
      "account_id": {
          "password": "hashed global account password",
          "dpt": ["32 bytes of hex in string format", "This is returned from the iOS device"],
          "pat": ["randomly generated push access tokens"],
          "transaction_id": "hashed transaction id from IAP receipt",
          "purchase_date": "date of purchase from last receipt",
          "expiration_date": "date of account expiration"
      }
    }

Server Functions
--------------

* `register(receipt)`
	* Verifies In-App Purchase receipt with Apple before account creation
	* Creates `accound_id` and `password` in database
* `reset_account(receipt)`
* `request_product_identifiers(store=iOS)`
	* Returns array of IAP product identifiers for chosen App Store
* `add_dpt(account_id, password, dpt)`
	* Updates the device push token for a user
* `request_pat(account_id, password)`
	* Returns a new push access token
* `list_pat(account_id, password)`
	* Returns a list of the currently active PATs
* `block_pat(account_id, password, pat)`
	* Removes a PAT from list of active PATs, removing it from the whitelist.
* `knock(account_id, pat, anonymous=false)`
	* Sends push message to active `dpt` associated with `account_id`
	* Only sent if `pat` is in the `account_id`'s whitelist 
	* If `anonymous` is `true`, don't send `pat` in push message.
